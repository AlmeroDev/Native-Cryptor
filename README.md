# NativeCryptor (Published 05.13.2018)

Hi, today I will tell you how to make a simple Cryptor in C ++ WITHOUT using .NET and other nonsense.

What does any cryptor consist of as a project:
1) Stub is a template with ready-made functions
2) Bilder - the program that fills the template

Functionality of the builder:
- Encrypting a file (virus) using XOR
- Pump the file. It will be implemented through "factor".
- Fill out the template

Functional Stab:
- Unpacking and starting the file in memory
- Protection from a virtual machine
- Mutation (random) code (curve)
